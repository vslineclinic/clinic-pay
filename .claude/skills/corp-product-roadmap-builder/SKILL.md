# Roadmap Builder

## Overview
The Roadmap Builder skill enables product managers to create clear, actionable product roadmaps that communicate strategy, align stakeholders, and guide execution. It combines prioritization frameworks, timeline planning, and dependency mapping.

## When to Use This Skill
- Planning quarterly or annual product strategy
- Communicating product vision to stakeholders
- Prioritizing features and initiatives
- Managing dependencies across teams
- Aligning engineering, design, marketing resources
- Creating investor/executive presentations
- Managing stakeholder expectations

## Roadmap Planning Framework

### Roadmap Horizon Definitions

**Immediate (Current Quarter - 0-12 weeks)**
- Confirmed features with clear specifications
- Active development or about to start
- High confidence in timeline and scope
- Team committed to delivery

**Near-term (Quarters 2-3 - 3-6 months)**
- Features with strong business case and customer demand
- Good understanding of requirements
- Medium confidence in timeline
- Provisional team allocation
- Detail level: High (features, rough effort estimates)

**Medium-term (Quarters 4-5 - 6-9 months)**

## Feature Prioritization

### Prioritization Matrix: Impact vs. Effort

```
         High Impact
              ↑
              │    [Quick Wins]    [Major Projects]
              │    Do first!       Plan carefully
              │
Effort ←──────●────────→
              │
              │   [Fill-ins]       [Avoid]
              │   Low priority     Deprioritize
              ↓
         Low Impact
```

**Quadrant Placement:**

**Quick Wins** (High impact, Low effort)
- Notification settings customization
- Dark mode support
- Search improvements
- Example: Real-time notifications (4 weeks, high user demand)

**Major Projects** (High impact, High effort)
- AI-powered recommendations
- Mobile app redesign
- Enterprise SSO integration
- Example: Real-time co-editing (12 weeks, strategic differentiator)

**Fill-Ins** (Low impact, Low effort)
- UI polish improvements
- Minor feature enhancements
- Bug fixes and technical debt
- Example: Additional export formats (2 weeks, low demand)

**Avoid** (Low impact, High effort)
- Requested but rarely used features
- Technical solutions to minor problems
- Complex integrations with low user count
- Example: Exotic compliance requirement with 2 users (10 weeks, rare need)

### RICE Prioritization Application

**Feature 1: Real-time Co-editing**
- Reach: 5,000 users (potential monthly)
- Impact: 3x (massive workflow improvement)
- Confidence: 90% (strong customer data)
- Effort: 12 weeks
- **RICE Score = (5000 × 3 × 0.9) / 12 = 1,125**

**Feature 2: Mobile App Redesign**
- Reach: 3,000 users (monthly mobile users)
- Impact: 2x (improved experience)
- Confidence: 80% (user feedback + analytics)
- Effort: 10 weeks
- **RICE Score = (3000 × 2 × 0.8) / 10 = 480**

**Feature 3: Dark Mode**
- Reach: 6,000 users (many would use)
- Impact: 1x (nice to have)
- Confidence: 75% (requested feature)
- Effort: 3 weeks
- **RICE Score = (6000 × 1 × 0.75) / 3 = 1,500**

**Prioritized Ranking:** Dark Mode (1,500) > Real-time Co-editing (1,125) > Mobile Redesign (480)

---

## Dependency Mapping

### Dependency Types

**Technical Dependencies** (Feature A requires Feature B)
- Example: Real-time co-editing requires WebSocket infrastructure
- Impact: Cannot ship feature until dependency complete
- Planning: Build in sequence, allocate effort for both

**Data Dependencies** (Feature requires data or infrastructure)
- Example: Analytics dashboard requires data warehouse implementation
- Impact: Delays feature if data work behind schedule
- Planning: Start data work early, plan parallel streams

**Organizational Dependencies** (Cross-team coordination)
- Example: Mobile redesign requires design system alignment
- Impact: Requires coordination, possible schedule conflicts
- Planning: Plan kick-off together, regular syncs

**External Dependencies** (Third-party or customer)
- Example: Enterprise SSO requires customer IT approval
- Impact: Out of control, high risk
- Planning: Start early, have backup plans

### Dependency Map Example

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         WebSocket Infrastructure (4w)           │
│              [Q2, Weeks 1-4]                    │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                   │ Required by
    ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
    │                             │
    v                             v
Real-time Updates (3w)    Co-editing Engine (6w)
[Q2, Weeks 5-7]           [Q2, Weeks 5-10]
    │                             │
    └──────────┬───────────────────┘
               v
        Activity Feed (2w)
       [Q2, Weeks 11-12]
```

### Critical Path Analysis

**Critical Path:** Longest sequence of dependent activities

```
WebSocket (4w) → Co-editing Engine (6w) → Activity Feed (2w) = 12 weeks

Non-critical path:
WebSocket (4w) → Real-time Updates (3w) = 7 weeks (5-week float)

Project completion: 12 weeks minimum
```

**Implications:**
- Cannot parallelize co-editing and activity feed
- Real-time updates can slip 5 weeks without impacting overall timeline
- Delays to WebSocket infrastructure delay entire project
- Resource freed from real-time updates after week 7 can join other work

## Roadmap Governance

### Approval and Change Process

**Change Request Intake:**
1. Request submitted with business justification
2. PM evaluates against current roadmap
3. If adding feature: Which quadrant in prioritization matrix?
4. If adding to current quarter: What gets bumped?
5. Approval criteria: RICE score, alignment with strategy

**Change Categories:**

**Critical Bugs or Compliance** (Expedited)
- Approve with minimal process
- Allocate from buffer/maintenance capacity
- Communicate impact to stakeholders

**Customer or Competitive Pressure** (Standard)
- Evaluate with prioritization framework
- Present trade-off (what gets delayed)
- Stakeholder review and approval

**Nice-to-have Requests** (Queue for consideration)
- Add to backlog for future prioritization
- Review quarterly for potential inclusion
- Track demand signals

**Rejected** (Document reasoning)
- Explain why outside current priorities
- Leave open for future reconsideration
- Provide alternative solutions if possible

### Stakeholder Review Cadence

**Weekly:** Product team sync (15 min check-in on progress)
**Monthly:** Stakeholder review (30 min status on completion, blockers)
**Quarterly:** Planning session (2-hour roadmap setting and approval)
**Annually:** Strategy review (full-day off-site on vision and direction)

---

## Roadmap Contingency Planning

### Risk Categories and Responses

**Technical Risk:**
- Risk: WebSocket scalability issues with 10K concurrent users
- Response: Load test early (W2-3), have fallback architecture
- Impact if realized: 3-week delay

**Resource Risk:**
- Risk: Key engineer leaves mid-quarter
- Response: Cross-training, knowledge documentation
- Contingency: Reduce feature scope or extend timeline

**Market Risk:**
- Risk: Competitor launches similar feature
- Response: Monitor landscape, acceleration plan ready
- Decision point: If competitor ships, accelerate timeline

**Execution Risk:**
- Risk: Requirements unclear, rework needed
- Response: Robust design review, customer validation
- Contingency: Time-box discovery, decide to pivot or proceed
