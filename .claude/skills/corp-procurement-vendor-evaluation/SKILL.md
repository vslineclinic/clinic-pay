| Hidden costs | Identify | Minimal | Minimal | Training extra |
| 3-year TCO | Compare | $285K | $270K | $290K |

## Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis

**Calculate True Cost Beyond License**:

```
VENDOR A - 3 YEAR TCO

ACQUISITION COSTS:
Software License (Year 1) | $50,000
Implementation Services | $30,000
Data Migration | $10,000
Initial Training (3 days) | $15,000
Subtotal | $105,000

ONGOING COSTS (Years 1-3):
Support & Maintenance (Y1) | $25,000
Support & Maintenance (Y2) | $26,250
Support & Maintenance (Y3) | $27,563
Annual Training Refresher (Y1) | $5,000
Annual Training Refresher (Y2) | $5,000
Annual Training Refresher (Y3) | $5,000
Infrastructure/Licenses (Y1) | $5,000
Infrastructure/Licenses (Y2) | $5,250
Infrastructure/Licenses (Y3) | $5,513
Software License Renewal (Y2) | $52,500
Software License Renewal (Y3) | $55,125
Subtotal | $217,388

HIDDEN COSTS:
Internal Project Management (500 hrs @ $100/hr) | $50,000
Vendor Management (100 hrs/year @ $100/hr) | $30,000
Process redesign (800 hrs @ $125/hr) | $100,000
Knowledge transfer (200 hrs @ $100/hr) | $20,000
System integration/customization (300 hrs @ $150/hr) | $45,000
Subtotal | $245,000

TOTAL 3-YEAR TCO | $567,388
```

**Cost Per User** (if 100 users):
- Year 1: $115,000 / 100 = $1,150/user
- 3 years: $567,388 / 100 = $5,674/user

**Comparison Across Vendors**:
- Vendor A: $567,388 (3-year TCO)
- Vendor B: $532,450 (3-year TCO)
- Vendor C: $625,000 (3-year TCO)

**Vendor B has lowest TCO** despite higher license cost; better support reduces internal costs.

## Risk Assessment Matrix

**Vendor Viability Risk**:

```
Risk Category | Vendor A | Vendor B | Vendor C | Mitigation
--------------|----------|----------|----------|----------
Financial Stability | Low | Medium | High | Request recent financials; check Dun & Bradstreet
Product Roadmap | Low | Low | Medium | Roadmap alignment with our priorities
Customer Concentration | Low | Medium | Low | Major customers (if <3, higher risk)
Key Personnel | Low | Medium | High | Ensure named resources committed to contracts
Technology Risk | Low | Low | Medium | Assess architecture scalability & maturity
Support Quality | Low | Low | High | Reference calls; ask about SLA breaches
Data Security | Low | Low | Medium | Require recent SOC 2 audit report
Integration Complexity | Low | Medium | Low | POC to verify integration capability
Switching Cost | Medium | High | Low | Cost to migrate if vendor fails
```

**Overall Risk Scoring** (1=Low, 3=Medium, 5=High):
- Vendor A: 8/50 (Low risk)
- Vendor B: 14/50 (Low-Medium risk)
- Vendor C: 24/50 (Medium risk)

## Reference Check Template

**Standard Reference Call** (30 minutes):

**Pre-Call**:
- Request 3 references from same industry
- Request 1-2 references with similar company size
- Request 1 reference from largest customer
- Ask vendor: "When was customer live? How long implemented?"

**Call Script**:

```
Hi [Name], thanks for taking time. I'm evaluating [Vendor] for [Use Case].
[Vendor] mentioned you're a customer; happy to verify that first?

1. RELATIONSHIP CONTEXT
- How long have you been a customer?
- What use cases do you primarily use it for?
- How many users do you have?
- How many internal resources did implementation require?

2. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE
- How long did implementation take? (vs. promised timeline)
- Were there unexpected costs or delays?
- How responsive was the vendor during implementation?
- Would you rate the data migration: Easy / Acceptable / Difficult?
- Did training resources match your needs?

3. PRODUCT FUNCTIONALITY
- Does it do what you need? Any significant gaps?
- Have you had to build custom integrations? How complex?
- Any performance issues or latency problems?
- How does it compare to competitors you evaluated?
- What features are you missing most?

4. VENDOR SUPPORT & SUCCESS
- How responsive is their support?
- Any SLA breaches you can recall?
- Do you have a dedicated customer success manager?
- Would you rate communication: Excellent / Good / Fair / Poor?
- Any unpleasant surprises (billing, features, behavior)?

5. RELIABILITY & OPERATIONS
- Have you experienced outages? How often? Duration?
- How's their security posture? Any concerns?
- Is data migration/export easy if you need to leave?
- How's their roadmap? Aligned with your needs?
- Are they financially stable in your view?

6. RECOMMENDATION
- Would you recommend them to a peer? Why/why not?
- What would you do differently if choosing again?
- Any advice for new customers?
- Can I reach out with follow-up questions?

7. CLOSING
- Thank you for your time and candor.
- I'll keep your feedback confidential.
```

**Reference Red Flags**:
- Hesitant to recommend
- Long implementation delays mentioned
- Unresolved technical issues
- Support unresponsiveness
- Cost overruns
- Data migration concerns
- Vendor not delivering roadmap commitments

## Weighted Scoring Model

**Establish Relative Importance** (weights sum to 100):

| Criterion | Weight | Vendor A | Vendor B | Vendor C |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Functionality (does it work?) | 25% | 95 | 90 | 75 |
| Implementation Timeline | 15% | 90 | 70 | 50 |
| Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) | 20% | 85 | 90 | 65 |
| Security & Compliance | 15% | 95 | 90 | 70 |
| Support & Success | 15% | 80 | 85 | 60 |
| Risk Profile (lower is better) | 10% | 92 | 85 | 70 |

**Weighted Score**:
- Vendor A: (95×.25) + (90×.15) + (85×.20) + (95×.15) + (80×.15) + (92×.10) = 89.9
- Vendor B: (90×.25) + (70×.15) + (90×.20) + (90×.15) + (85×.15) + (85×.10) = 84.5
- Vendor C: (75×.25) + (50×.15) + (65×.20) + (70×.15) + (60×.15) + (70×.10) = 66.0

**Recommendation**: Vendor A (highest score), but Vendor B competitive on cost.

## Proof of Concept (POC)

**When to Require POC**:
- Complex technical integration
- Critical functionality concerns
- Unproven vendor or new product
- High switching costs if wrong choice
- Custom workflow requirements

**POC Scope**:
- **Objective**: Verify integration and core functionality
- **Duration**: 2-4 weeks
- **Cost**: [Usually vendor cost; sometimes shared]
- **Resources**: [# developers, data] needed for POC
- **Success Criteria**: [Specific technical outcomes]

**POC Plan Example**:
```
Week 1: Vendor sets up sandbox environment
        Our team imports sample data
        Basic user testing

Week 2: API integration testing
        Real-time sync validation
        Reporting accuracy verification

Week 3: Load testing (1000 users simulation)
        Edge case handling
        Security vulnerability scan

Week 4: Documentation review
        Go/No-Go decision
        Roadmap discussion if proceeding
```

**POC Decision Gate**:
- If POC successful: Proceed to contract
- If minor gaps: Document workarounds; proceed with conditions
- If significant gaps: Re-evaluate alternatives or custom development

## Vendor Negotiation Strategy

**Leverage Points** (use in negotiation):

1. **Competition**: "We're evaluating 3 vendors; your pricing needs to be competitive"
2. **Volume Commitment**: "If you can hit $90K, we'll commit 3-year contract"
3. **Long-term Partnership**: "We want a 3-year relationship with guaranteed renewal"
4. **Reference Status**: "We'll be your primary reference in our industry"
5. **Implementation Support**: "We have strong internal resources to minimize your services"

**Negotiation Playbook**:

```
ROUND 1 - OPENING (Initial proposals)
- Standard pricing: $115K
- Standard SLA: 99.9%
- Standard support: Business hours

ROUND 2 - INITIAL NEGOTIATION
- Your ask: "We need 24/7 support included for $100K"
- Vendor likely counter: "24/7 support costs extra; we can do $115K + $15K"
- Counter-counter: "If you include 24/7, we'll commit 3-year deal today ($95K/yr)"

ROUND 3 - VALUE-ADD NEGOTIATION
- Ask for free items: First year training, data migration, setup
- Vendor likely says: "No, those are paid services"
- Negotiate bundling: "Include all of those + 24/7 support for $110K/year"

ROUND 4 - FINAL OFFERS
- Get vendor's best offer in writing
- Make final counter-offer based on total value
- Establish walk-away price: If >$115K all-in, re-evaluate alternatives
```

**Non-Price Negotiables**:
- SLA penalties (require credits for breaches)
- Data export/migration assistance
- Transition support (if switching vendors)
- Key personnel commitment (named resources)
- Roadmap alignment (when will features appear?)
- Early termination clause (if not working)
