# Onboarding Playbook

## Overview

Design comprehensive onboarding playbooks that accelerate time-to-value, ensure customer success, and build strong product adoption. Effective onboarding sets the foundation for long-term customer health, expansion, and retention.

## Onboarding Goals

**Primary Objectives**:

- Achieve 80% adoption of core features within 60 days
- Build internal champion for product expansion
- Establish positive relationship and trust
- Enable customer to operate independently

**Success Metrics**:
- Time to first value: 7-14 days
- First 30 days: Core workflows operational
- By day 60: 80% core features adopted; team trained
- By day 90: Expansion conversation; roadmap discussion
- By month 6: Renewal conversation with confidence

## Common Onboarding Mistakes (To Avoid)

1. **Unclear Success Criteria**: Define success before starting
2. **No Dedicated CSM**: Customer needs single point of contact
3. **Insufficient Training**: Time investment upfront prevents support burden later
4. **Scope Creep**: Say no to out-of-scope requests; track for phase 2
5. **Poor Change Management**: Address user resistance; get champions
6. **Technical Readiness Gaps**: Assume nothing; validate all assumptions
7. **Neglecting Data Quality**: Bad data in = bad results out
8. **Over-Customization**: Encourage vendor best practices, not custom workflows
9. **No Contingency Plan**: Assume something will go wrong; have rollback plan
10. **Ending Too Early**: Hypercare shouldn't end until independence confirmed
