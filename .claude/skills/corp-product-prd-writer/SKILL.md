# PRD Writer

## Overview
The PRD Writer skill guides product managers in creating clear, actionable Product Requirements Documents that align teams around feature specifications. It combines user-centered design, technical clarity, and business context to ensure successful implementation.

## When to Use This Skill
- Defining new features or products for development
- Communicating requirements to engineering teams
- Prioritizing features across roadmap
- Documenting feature specifications before development
- Communicating product vision to stakeholders
- Creating specifications for design and QA teams

**Data Model Changes:** [Database schema updates]

#### Functional Requirements

**Requirement 1: Real-Time Status Updates**
- System shall broadcast task status changes to all project members within 2 seconds
- Broadcast includes: task ID, new status, previous status, timestamp, user who made change
- System shall maintain 99.9% uptime for status broadcasting
- System shall handle up to 1,000 concurrent status updates per project

**Requirement 2: Activity Feed Display**

- User can choose delivery method per activity type: in-app, email, Slack, mobile push
- Notifications shall respect do-not-disturb hours (if configured)
- System shall batch notifications to prevent notification fatigue (max 1 email per hour)

#### Technical Specifications

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: [React 18, TypeScript]
- Backend: [Node.js, Express]
- Database: [PostgreSQL]
- Real-time: [WebSockets, Socket.io]
- Notifications: [SendGrid for email, FCM for mobile, Slack API]

**API Endpoints:**

```
POST /api/tasks/{taskId}/status
Updates task status, triggers broadcast

GET /api/projects/{projectId}/activity
Fetches activity feed with pagination

PUT /api/notifications/preferences
Updates user notification settings

POST /api/notifications/subscribe
Subscribes to WebSocket for real-time updates
```

**Database Schema Changes:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE activity_feeds (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id),
  actor_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  action_type VARCHAR(50), -- task_updated, comment_added, etc.
  target_id UUID, -- task, comment, project
  target_type VARCHAR(50),
  changes JSONB, -- before/after values
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE notification_settings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  activity_type VARCHAR(50),
  email BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  in_app BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  slack BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  mobile_push BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  dnd_start TIME,
  dnd_end TIME
);
```

### UI/UX Specifications

#### Wireframe Descriptions

**Screen 1: Activity Feed**
```
[Header: "Activity"]
[Filter bar: Activity Type dropdown, Date range picker]
[Activity Item 1]
├─ [Avatar] [Name] [Action] [Context]
├─ [Timestamp] [2 hours ago]
└─ [Details: Task name, Previous → New status]

[Activity Item 2]
...
[Load more button]
```

**Screen 2: Notification Settings Modal**
```
[Header: "Notification Preferences"]
[Tabs: Delivery Methods | Do Not Disturb]

[Activity Type Toggles]
├─ Task Status Updated
│  ├─ ☑ Email ☑ In-app ☑ Mobile Push
│  ├─ Batch these notifications (dropdown: real-time, daily, weekly)
├─ New Comment
│  ├─ ☑ Email ☑ In-app ☑ Mobile Push
├─ Task Assigned to Me
│  ├─ ☑ Email ☑ In-app ☑ Mobile Push

[Save] [Cancel]
```

#### Design Considerations

- **Visual hierarchy:** Activity items show most important info first
- **Progressive disclosure:** Click item to see full details
- **Accessibility:** Color not only indicator (✓ + color for status changes)
- **Performance:** Virtual scrolling for large feeds (1000+ items)
- **Mobile:** Single-column layout, touch-friendly tap targets (44px min)

### Prioritization Framework: RICE

**RICE Scoring Formula:** (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

**Reach** (How many users affected in 3-month period)
- Example: 80% of active users = 8,000 users
- Scale: 0-10,000+

**Impact** (How much does this change user outcome)
- Massive (3x): Huge improvement in workflow
- High (2x): Significant improvement in efficiency
- Medium (1x): Noticeable improvement
- Low (0.5x): Minor improvement

**Confidence** (How confident are we in this estimate)
- High (100%): Based on customer data/usage patterns
- Medium (75%): Some user feedback, some assumptions
- Low (50%): Speculative, needs validation

**Effort** (How many person-weeks to implement)
- Small: 1-2 weeks
- Medium: 3-4 weeks
- Large: 5-8 weeks
- XL: 8+ weeks

**RICE Calculation Example:**
- Reach: 8,000 users
- Impact: 2x (high)
- Confidence: 75%
- Effort: 4 weeks

Rice Score = (8000 × 2 × 0.75) / 4 = 3,000

- Advanced activity analytics
- Activity timeline visualization

**Won't Have** (Explicitly out of scope)
- SMS notifications
- Voice notifications
- Calendar integration for notifications

**Engagement:**
- Daily active users: 50% of active users daily
- Activity feed views: Average 8 views per user per day
- Notification opens: 35% of delivered notifications opened

**Business Impact:**
- Time savings: Users report 30% reduction in status-checking time
- Meeting reduction: Average meeting duration reduced by 15 minutes/week
- Retention: Feature users have 10% higher 12-month retention

**Quality Metrics:**

### Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| WebSocket scalability issues | High | Medium | Load test with 10K concurrent users before launch |
| Notification fatigue causing opt-outs | High | Medium | Implement smart batching and do-not-disturb by default |
| Mobile app notification permissions | Medium | High | Provide clear education on benefits before permission request |
| Slack integration delays | Low | Medium | Build without Slack first, add as phase 2 |
